It's clear from these plots the HTC is a noisier variable than SFL. I've applied a rolling window (along the latitude axis) in some supplementary figures below to show that smoothing the data helps a little, but it's clear that the energy budget in these models isn't exactly closed (Figures \ref{fig:csiro_supp} and \ref{fig:giss_supp}).
