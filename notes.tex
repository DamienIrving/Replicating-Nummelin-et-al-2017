I have verified these native grid plots with Aleksi Nummelin so I'm confident they are free of any data processing errors. They reveal a number of interesting things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The regridding is the cause of the issues with Figure \ref{fig:noresm_full}. I was hoping the native grid would align closely enough with a lat/lon grid to avoid the need to regrid at all, but it seems that isn't the case.
\item The heat budget closes better in some models than others. I've applied a rolling window (along the latitude axis) in some supplementary figures below to show that smoothing the data helps a little, but it's clear that the energy budget in these models isn't closed even after smoothing (Figures \ref{fig:csiro_supp} and \ref{fig:giss_supp}). This could presumably be due to a number of factors: model drift, other mechanisms by which energy can be transferred through the ocean (e.g. diffusion), etc. In email correspondence, Aleksi suggested that for some models it may not be appropriate to use diff(hfy) to quantify convergence. An alternative would be to use ($\overline{OHC'} - \overline{SFL}$}). He was hesitant to do that in his paper (because quadratic growth is a pretty strong assumption for the OHC), but it might actually be more accurate than diff(hfy).
\end{enumerate}
