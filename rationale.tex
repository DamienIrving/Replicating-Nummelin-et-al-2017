I'm attempting to replicate Figure 1b of \citet{Nummelin_2017} so that I can create a similar plot comparing the ocean response to anthropogenic aerosols (i.e. the historicalAA experiment) and greenhouse gases (historicalGHG). I've focused on three key curves from Figure 1b: the trend in ocean heat transport convergence ($\overline{HTC}$), surface heat flux at ocean surface ($\overline{SFL}$) and ocean heat content tendency ($\overline{OHC'}$}).
