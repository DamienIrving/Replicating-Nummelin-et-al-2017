\section{Next steps}

Once I can replicate Figure 1b using hfbasin data I'll move on to the more complex task of doing it with hfy and hfx data. I've got an active issue with the developers of the iris Python library to see if it's possible to use one of their functions for mapping vector quantities (like hfy and hfx) from a curvilinear to rectilinear grid: \url{https://github.com/SciTools/iris/issues/2572}
