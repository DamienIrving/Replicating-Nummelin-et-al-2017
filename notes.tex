It's clear from these plots the HTC is a noisier variable than SFL. I've applied a rolling window (along the latitude axis) in some supplementary figures below to show that smoothing the data helps a little, but it's clear that the energy budget in these models isn't exactly closed (Figures \ref{fig:csiro_supp} and \ref{fig:giss_supp}). This could presumably be due to a number of factors: model drift, other mechanisms by which energy can be transferred through the ocean (e.g. diffusion), etc.
