Top panel: Average annual mean ocean heat transport convergence (HTC; calculated from hfbasin data) and surface heat flux (SFL) over the period 2006--2100 for the GISS-E2-R model (rcp85 experiment, r1i1p1). For comparison, the trend in ocean heat content (OHC) is also plotted (ideally, the trend in OHC would be equal to the sum of the HTC and SFL). Bottom panel: Linear trend in HTC, SFL and OHC tendency (calculation described below).
